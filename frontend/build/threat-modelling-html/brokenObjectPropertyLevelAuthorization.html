    <p>
To threat model an API with a vulnerability categorised under
 "API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization" according to the STRIDE and DREAD models, 
 it's crucial first to understand what this vulnerability entails. "Broken Object Property Level Authorization"
  occurs when an API does not adequately enforce access controls on a per-user (or per-role) basis at the property
   level of an object, leading to unauthorised access or modification of data.</p>


<h3>STRIDE Model</h3>

<p>
STRIDE is a threat modelling methodology that categorises security threats into six categories: 
Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Spoofing: Low to Medium.</strong> While spoofing (impersonating another user) is not directly related to
 property level authorization, exploiting broken object property level authorization could be easier
  if an attacker can first spoof another user's identity.
</p>

 <p>
    <strong>Tampering: Critical.</strong> Broken object property level authorization directly impacts the integrity of 
data, as unauthorised users could alter data they should not have access to.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Repudiation: High.</strong> In the absence of proper authorization checks, malicious users might modify or 
delete data without being traced, as they are not supposed to have access in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Information Disclosure: Critical.</strong> This category is directly impacted because unauthorised 
access to object properties could lead to sensitive data exposure.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Denial of Service (DoS): Low.</strong> While not directly related, if an attacker continuously exploits
 this vulnerability to alter data, it could lead to a denial of service for legitimate users.
</p>

 <p>
    <strong>Elevation of Privilege: Critical.</strong> The very nature of this vulnerability allows users to access 
or modify data at a level they should not be able to, effectively elevating their privileges within the application.
</p>

<h3>DREAD Model</h3>

<p>
    <strong>DREAD is another threat modelling methodology that assesses the severity of security threats based on five 
categories: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Damage Potential: High to Critical.</strong> If exploited, this vulnerability could lead 
to significant data breaches or unauthorised data modifications, causing substantial harm to the organisation and its users.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Reproducibility: High.</strong> If the vulnerability is well-known and the API lacks proper
 authorization checks, it might be easy for attackers to reproduce the attack.
</p>

 <p>
    <strong>Exploitability: Medium to High.</strong> The ease of exploitation depends on the specific 
implementation of the API and how the authorization checks are conducted or bypassed.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Affected Users: High.</strong> Depending on the application's user base and the data exposed, 
a large segment of users could be impacted by this vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Discoverability: Medium to High.</strong> If an attacker is actively probing for vulnerabilities
 or if there is a lack of monitoring and logging, discovering this vulnerability could be relatively straightforward.
