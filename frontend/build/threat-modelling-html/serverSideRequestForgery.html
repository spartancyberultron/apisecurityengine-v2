<p>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send crafted requests from a 
vulnerable web application to internal systems behind the firewall. The attacker can potentially access or manipulate internal
 resources that were not intended to be exposed. In the context of APIs, this can be particularly concerning because APIs often interact 
 with various internal and external services.


<p>When performing a threat model for SSRF vulnerabilities, particularly API 7:2023, it's important to consider both 
STRIDE and DREAD models to evaluate the risks comprehensively. Here's how you might categorise the threat based on these models:


<h3>STRIDE Model for API 7:2023 (SSRF)</h3>

<p>STRIDE is a model used to identify and categorise security threats based on six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, 
Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege.</p>

<p><strong>(Critical):</strong> SSRF can allow an attacker to impersonate the server or another internal service, making requests
 that appear legitimate.</p>

<p><strong>Tampering (High):</strong> If the SSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to modify internal HTTP requests, this could lead to 
unauthorised changes in data or system configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Repudiation (Medium):</strong> SSRF attacks may not always leave a clear trail, especially if the attacker can mask their actions 
as legitimate requests from the vulnerable server, complicating auditing and tracking.</p>

<p><strong>Information Disclosure (Critical):</strong> SSRF can expose sensitive information from internal services that are not intended 
to be accessible, posing a significant risk.</p>

<p><strong>Denial of Service (High):</strong> By abusing SSRF, an attacker could target internal systems, potentially leading to a denial of service for critical 
    infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Elevation of Privilege (High):</strong> Depending on the systems accessible via SSRF, an attacker might escalate their privileges within the network.</p>

<h3>DREAD Model for API 7:2023 (SSRF)</h3>

<p>DREAD is another risk assessment model used to quantify, prioritise, and 
compare different types of threats. It stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.</p>


<p><strong>Damage (Critical):</strong> The potential damage from SSRF can be very high, including data breaches, internal system 
compromise, and exposure of sensitive information.</p>

<p><strong>Reproducibility (High):</strong> If an attacker knows about the SSRF vulnerability, it can be relatively easy to reproduce the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Exploitability (Medium):</strong> The difficulty of exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities can vary, but often it requires some knowledge of
 the internal network and the targeted application's behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Affected Users (High):</strong> Depending on the application and the nature of the SSRF vulnerability, the number of affected users could 
be extensive, especially if critical systems are compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Discoverability (Medium):</strong> Discovering SSRF vulnerabilities might require some effort from the attacker, such as understanding the 
application's architecture and internal services. However, once identified, the vulnerability can be highly exploitable.</p>
