To address the vulnerability "API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization"
 within the STRIDE and DREAD threat modelling frameworks, we need to categorise the threat levels according to these models.
</p>


<h3>STRIDE Model Analysis</h3>

<p>STRIDE is an acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.</p>

<p>
<strong>Spoofing (Critical):</strong> Given that broken function level authorization can allow unauthorised users 
to impersonate others or assume roles they shouldn't have, the risk is critical. An attacker
 could exploit this vulnerability to spoof a legitimate user's identity.</p>


 <p><strong></strong>Tampering (High): If an attacker gains access to functionalities not intended for 
their use, they might be able to alter data or the system's behaviour. The severity is 
high because it could lead to data integrity issues but requires specific conditions to exploit effectively.
Repudiation (Medium): This vulnerability indirectly increases the risk of repudiation 
threats because an attacker might perform actions without proper logging or accountability. 
However, it's more about the absence of controls than a direct consequence of broken function level authorization.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Information Disclosure (Critical): Unauthorised access to functions often leads to unauthorised access to data. 
If an attacker can invoke functions they shouldn't, sensitive information might be exposed, making this threat critical.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Denial of Service (Low): While not directly related, exploiting this vulnerability could lead to conditions
 where services are misused or overloaded unintentionally. The impact is typically lower compared to other threats in this context.</p>

 <p><strong></strong>Elevation of Privilege (Critical): This is the most direct threat associated with broken function level authorization.
 Attackers could elevate their privileges by accessing functions reserved for higher-privileged users, posing a critical threat.</p>

<h3>DREAD Model Analysis</h3>

<p>DREAD stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.</p>

<p><strong>Damage (High):</strong> The potential damage from exploiting broken function level authorization can be high, leading to
 data breaches, loss of integrity, and unauthorised actions within the system.</p>

<p><strong>Reproducibility (Medium):</strong> Depending on the complexity of the API and the implementation details, 
the vulnerability might be more or less easy to reproduce by attackers.</p>

<p><strong>Exploitability (High):</strong> If the authorization flaw is well-understood and documented, it might be
 relatively easy for an attacker to exploit, especially if detailed error messages or API documentation is publicly available.</p>

<p><strong>Affected Users (High):</strong> Given that this vulnerability could impact the security posture of 
the entire API, potentially all users of the system could be affected by its exploitation. </p>

<p><strong>Discoverability (Medium):</strong> The ease with which this issue can be discovered depends on the level
 of access an attacker has and the amount of information available about the API. In some cases, 
 it might require in-depth knowledge or insider information. </p>
