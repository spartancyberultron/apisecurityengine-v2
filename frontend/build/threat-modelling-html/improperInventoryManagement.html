    <p>
Threat modelling for APIs, particularly for the vulnerability categorised as "API 9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management"
 under the OWASP API Security Top 10, involves analysing potential threats based on models like STRIDE and DREAD. 
 These models help in understanding and prioritising threats based on their impact and likelihood.
</p>


<h3>STRIDE Model for API 9:2023</h3>


<p>STRIDE is a model used to identify security threats based on six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation,
 Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege.
</p>

<p><strong>Spoofing (Critical):</strong> Not directly related to inventory management, but improper inventory could lead to misconfiguration
 that exposes endpoints to unauthorised access.
</p>

<p><strong>Tampering (High):</strong> If attackers discover untracked or poorly managed APIs, they could modify data in transit or at rest.
</p>

<p><strong>Repudiation (Medium):</strong> Improper inventory management might lead to insufficient logging, making it difficult to track who did what.
</p>

<p><strong>Information Disclosure (High):</strong> Exposing more APIs than necessary or failing to secure them properly could lead to unintended data exposure.
</p>


<p><strong>Denial of Service (Medium):</strong> Poorly managed and unprotected APIs could be more susceptible to DoS attacks due to unknown or unmonitored endpoints 
being exploited.
</p>

<p><strong>Elevation of Privilege (Critical):</strong> An attacker could exploit untracked APIs to gain unauthorised access or escalate privileges within a system.
</p>

<h3>DREAD Model for API 9:2023</h3>


<p>DREAD is another model to quantify, prioritise, and compare the level of risk in a consistent manner. It stands for Damage, Reproducibility, 
Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.
</p>

<p><strong>Damage Potential (High):</strong> If an attacker exploits improperly managed APIs, the potential damage could range from data breaches to system compromise.
</p>

<p><strong>Reproducibility (Medium):</strong> The reproducibility of an attack depends on how well-known the unmanaged APIs are and the skills of the attacker.
</p>

<p><strong>Exploitability (High):</strong> Poor inventory management could lead to easily exploitable vulnerabilities for attackers who discover these APIs.
</p>

<p><strong>Affected Users (High):</strong> Depending on the API's role, the number of affected users could be vast, especially if critical data or services are compromised.
</p>

<p><strong>Discoverability (Medium to High):</strong> Untracked or improperly managed APIs might be harder to discover than known vulnerabilities, but dedicated 
attackers or automated tools can still find them.
