    To calculate the cost of a data breach for API 9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management, 
    let's follow the provided formula and outline how each component could affect the total cost. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Since specific numbers are not provided in your question, I'll give you an illustrative example to demonstrate 
    how to use the formula with hypothetical numbers. The actual numbers would depend on detailed information from the scenario at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
Let's assume the following hypothetical scenario:
</p>

<h4>
Direct Costs:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Incident investigation and analysis costs: $50,000</li>
<li>Remediation costs, including security improvements: $100,000</li>
<li>Legal expenses, including fines and settlements: $200,000</li>
<li>Notification costs to inform affected individuals and regulators: $30,000</li>
<li>Credit monitoring services for affected individuals: $20,000</li>
</ul>


<h4>Indirect Costs:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Loss of productivity: $80,000</li>
<li>Increased insurance premiums: $10,000</li>
<li>Operational disruptions: $70,000</li>
<li>Loss of customers and associated revenue: $150,000</li>
<li>Damage to brand and reputation: Estimated as a $200,000 impact on future earnings</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Opportunity Costs:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lost business opportunities: $100,000</li>
<li>Increased cost of acquiring new customers: $50,000</li>
<li>Number of Records Breached: 10,000 records</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given these figures, let's calculate the total cost of a data breach:
</p>

<p>
Calculate the sum of Direct, Indirect, and Opportunity Costs.
</p>

<p>
Multiply the sum by the Number of Records Breached to find the Total Cost of the Data Breach.
</p>

<p>
Let's perform the calculations.
</p>

<p>Based on the hypothetical data provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs: $400,000</li>
<li>Indirect Costs: $510,000</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs: $150,000</li>
</ul>

<p>
The formula for calculating the total cost of a data breach in this scenario is:</p>



<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=(Direct Costs+Indirect Costs+Opportunity Costs)Ã—Number of Records Breached

Given the numbers, the total cost of a data breach would be:
$106,000,000
</pre>

<p>
This calculation is a simplified example. The actual cost of a data breach can vary
 significantly based on numerous factors, including the nature of the compromised data, 
 the response measures taken by the organisation, the impact on the organisation's reputation, and more.
