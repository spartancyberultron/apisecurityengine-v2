    APISecurityEngine formula by incorporating both specific numerical values and percentages. 
    </p>


<p>
    The formula breaks down the total cost into direct costs, indirect costs, and opportunity costs, 
    multiplied by the number of records breached. Let's delve into each category with hypothetical values to understand 
    how to calculate the cost in both numbers and percentages.
    </p>


    <p>Expected Scenario</p>

    <ul>
<li>Number of Records Breached: 100,000 records</li>
<li>Direct Costs: $50 per record</li>
<li>Incident Investigation: $10 per record</li>
<li>Remediation Costs: $15 per record</li>
<li>Legal Expenses: $5 per record</li>
<li>Notification Costs: $10 per record</li>
<li>Credit Monitoring Services: $10 per record</li>
<li>Indirect Costs: $30 per record</li>
<li>Loss of Productivity: $10 per record</li>
<li>Increased Insurance Premiums: $5 per record</li>
<li>Operational Disruptions: $5 per record</li>
<li>Loss of Customers & Revenue: $7 per record</li>
<li>Damage to Brand & Reputation: $3 per record</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs: $20 per record</li>
<li>Lost Business Opportunities: $10 per record</li>
Increased Cost of Acquiring New Customers: $10 per record</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Given these hypothetical values, let's calculate the total cost.
</p>

<h4>
Calculation:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs Total = $50 per record * 100,000 records = $5,000,000</li>
<li>Indirect Costs Total = $30 per record * 100,000 records = $3,000,000</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs Total = $20 per record * 100,000 records = $2,000,000</li>
<li>Total Cost of Data Breach = ($5,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $2,000,000) = $10,000,000</li>
</ul>

<h4>Percentage Breakdown</h4>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs Percentage: $5,000,000 / $10,000,000 = 50%</li>
<li>Indirect Costs Percentage: $3,000,000 / $10,000,000 = 30%</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs Percentage: $2,000,000 / $10,000,000 = 20%</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Summary:
</h4>

<p>
In this scenario, the total cost of a data breach is $10,000,000, 
with direct costs constituting 50% of the total, indirect costs making up 30%, and opportunity costs contributing to the remaining 20%.
