   <p> To calculate the cost of a data breach for API 3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization, 
    APISecurityEngine using the provided formula and considering the absence of specific numbers for Direct Costs, Indirect Costs, 
    Opportunity Costs, and the Number of Records Breached, we need to establish estimates or average values for each of these components. </p>
    
   <p> This is demonstrating how this calculation could be approached:</p>

   <ul>

    <li>
Direct Costs (DC): These might include the immediate expenses related to the breach, such as investigation, 
remediation, legal fees, notifications, and credit monitoring. Suppose the direct costs total $500,000.</li>

<li>
Indirect Costs (IC): These costs are more difficult to quantify and include long-term impacts 
like lost productivity, increased insurance premiums, operational disruptions, customer churn, and brand damage. Let's estimate these at $300,000.</li>

<li>
Opportunity Costs (OC): This refers to the lost business opportunities and the increased cost
 of acquiring new customers due to the breach. Assuming this amounts to $200,000.
 </li>

 <li>
Number of Records Breached (NRB): The total number of records compromised in the breach. For
 our example, let's say 10,000 records were breached.
 </li>

</ul>

<p>
Using the formula provided:
</p>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=(DC+IC+OC)×NRB
</pre>

<p>
Substituting the values into the formula:
</p>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=($500,000+$300,000+$200,000)×10,000
</pre>

<p>
Let's calculate the total cost based on these figures.
</p>

<p>
Based on the example provided, the total cost of the data breach for API 3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization would be $10,000,000,000.
</p>

<p>
This calculation is based on the assumed direct costs of $500,000, indirect costs of $300,000,
 opportunity costs of $200,000, and the number of records breached being 10,000. </p>
 
 <p>
 It's important to remember that this is a simplified example, and actual costs can vary 
 significantly based on numerous factors specific to each incident.
