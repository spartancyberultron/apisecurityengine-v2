   <p> To calculate the cost of a data breach specifically for the OWASP API2:2023 - Broken Authentication scenario, 
    APISecurityEngine uses the general formula, we would need specific values for each component mentioned in the formula. </p>
    
    <p>However, without explicit numbers for direct costs, indirect costs, opportunity costs, and the number of records breached,
     it's not possible to calculate an exact figure.</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of how this approach the calculation if there is a specific data:</p>

<ul>

<li>Direct Costs: This would include the total sum of costs for incident investigation, 
    remediation, legal expenses, notifications, and credit monitoring services.</li>

<li>Indirect Costs: This would sum up the loss of productivity, increased insurance premiums, 
    operational disruptions, loss of customers/revenue, and damage to the brand.</li>

<li>Opportunity Costs: This would estimate the financial impact of lost business opportunities and the
     increased cost of acquiring new customers due to damaged trust.</li>

<li>Number of Records Breached: The total number of individual pieces of information compromised.</li>

</ul>


<p>
With actual numbers for these categories, you would use the formula:
</p>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=(Direct Costs+Indirect Costs+Opportunity Costs)Ã—Number of Records Breached
</pre>

<p>
Example Calculation (Assuming hypothetical values)
</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs = $500,000</li>
<li>Indirect Costs = $300,000</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs = $200,000</li>
<li>Number of Records Breached = 10,000</li>
</ul>

<pre>
{Total Cost} = ($500,000 + $300,000 + $200,000) \times 10,000 = \$1,000,000,000
</pre>

<p>
This would mean the total cost of the data breach is $1 billion.
