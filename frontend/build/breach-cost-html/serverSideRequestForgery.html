   <p> To calculate the cost of a data breach for API 7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF),
     using the provided general formula and understanding that the actual data (such as direct, indirect, 
     and opportunity costs, along with the number of records breached) specific to this incident isn't directly provided, 
     I'll guide you through a hypothetical scenario based on the formula.  </p>
     
    <p> This will illustrate how to approach such 
     a calculation in percentage and numbers, using assumed values for each category.  </p>
     
  <p>   Remember, the actual values would depend on detailed analysis and specific incident data. </p>

  <h4>
Hypothetical Scenario Calculation
</h4>

<p>
Let's assume some values for a hypothetical SSRF data breach:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs: $500,000 (e.g., investigation, remediation, legal, notification, credit monitoring)</li>
<li>Indirect Costs: $300,000 (e.g., loss of productivity, increased insurance premiums, operational disruptions, customer loss)</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs: $200,000 (e.g., lost business opportunities, increased customer acquisition cost)</li>
</ul>

<pre>
Number of Records Breached: 10,000 records
</pre>

<p>Using the formula:</p>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=(Direct Costs+Indirect Costs+Opportunity Costs)×Number of Records Breached
Total Cost of Data Breach=(500,000+300,000+200,000)×10,000
</pre>


<p>
First, let's calculate the total costs (Direct + Indirect + Opportunity) and 
then multiply by the number of records breached to find the total cost of the data breach. </p>

<p>
Let's proceed with the calculation.
</p>

<p>
In this hypothetical scenario:
</p>

<pre>
The total costs per record (combining direct, indirect, and opportunity costs) amount to $1,000,000.
The total cost of the data breach, when considering 10,000 records breached, would be $10,000,000,000.
</pre>

<p>
This illustrates the potential financial impact of a data breach on an organisation, emphasising the 
significance of robust security measures to prevent such incidents.
