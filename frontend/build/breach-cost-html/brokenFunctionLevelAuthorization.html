    <p>
        Let's assume some hypothetical values for a scenario involving the API 5:2023 - Broken Function Level
        Authorization breach:
    </p>

    <pre>
    Direct Costs: $500,000
    </pre>

    <p>
        This could include investigation and analysis, remediation costs, legal expenses, notification costs, and credit
        monitoring services.
    </p>

    <pre>
    Indirect Costs: $300,000
    </pre>

    <p>
        This might cover loss of productivity, increased insurance premiums, operational disruptions,
        loss of customers and revenue, and damage to brand and reputation.
    </p>

    <pre>
    Opportunity Costs: $200,000
    </pre>

    <p>
        Possible lost business opportunities and increased customer acquisition costs could be included here.
    </p>

    <pre>
    Number of Records Breached: 10,000 records
    </pre>

    <p>
        Given these hypothetical values, let's calculate the Total Cost of Data Breach:
    </p>

    <pre>
    Total Cost of Data Breach=(Direct Costs+Indirect Costs+Opportunity Costs)×Number of Records Breached
    </pre>

    <p>
        Substituting the hypothetical values:
    </p>


    <pre>
    Total Cost of Data Breach=(500,000+300,000+200,000)×10,000
    </pre>


    <p>
        Let's calculate this total cost.
    </p>

    <pre>
    Based on the hypothetical values provided, the total cost of the data breach would be $10,000,000,000.
    </pre>

    <p>
        This example illustrates how the costs associated with a data breach can quickly escalate, especially as the
        number of breached records increases.
