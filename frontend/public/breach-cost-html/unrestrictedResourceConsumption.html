   <p> To calculate the cost of a data breach for API 4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption 
    using the information you've provided, we would need specific numbers for the variables involved, 
    such as the direct costs, indirect costs, opportunity costs, and the number of records breached. </p>
    
   <p> Since you haven't provided these specific values, I'll show you a hypothetical 
    example using assumed figures to illustrate how you would calculate the cost in both percentage and numerical forms. </p>

<p>Let's assume the following hypothetical costs for a data breach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs: $500,000</li>
<li>Incident investigation: $100,000</li>
<li>Remediation and security improvements: $200,000</li>
<li>Legal expenses, fines, and settlements: $100,000</li>
<li>Notification and credit monitoring: $100,000</li>
<li>Indirect Costs: $300,000</li>
<li>Loss of productivity: $100,000</li>
<li>Increased insurance premiums: $50,000</li>
<li>Operational disruptions: $50,000</li>
<li>Loss of customers/revenue: $100,000</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs: $200,000</li>
<li>Lost business opportunities: $100,000</li>
<li>Increased customer acquisition costs: $100,000</li>
<li>Number of Records Breached: 10,000 records</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the formula:
</p>


<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=(Direct Costs+Indirect Costs+Opportunity Costs)Ã—Number of Records Breached
</pre>

<p>
Let's calculate the total cost.
</p>

<p>
Based on the hypothetical values provided, 
the total cost of the data breach for API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption would 
be $10,000,000,000. 
</p>

<p>
This calculation assumes direct costs of $500,000, indirect costs of $300,000, opportunity costs of $200,000, and that 10,000 records were breached.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the cost of a data breach according to 
the provided formula, we need specific values for each component of the formula, 
which are not directly given in your message. However, I can guide you through how to apply the formula 
using hypothetical numbers to give you an idea of how the calculation works.
