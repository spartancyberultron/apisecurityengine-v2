 <p> To calculate the cost of a data breach from the information you've provided - for AP I10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs, 
    let's break down the formula and apply hypothetical numbers for a clearer understanding, 
    as you haven't provided specific figures for direct costs, indirect costs, opportunity costs, or the number of records breached. </p>

<h4>    
Formula Recap:</h4>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach = (Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Opportunity Costs) x Number of Records Breached
</pre>


<h4>
Categories Explained:
</h4>

<p>
Direct Costs: Expenses directly associated with addressing the breach (investigation, remediation, legal fees, notifications, credit monitoring).
</p>

<p>
Indirect Costs: Costs that are not directly tied to the breach response but occur as a consequence (productivity loss, increased premiums,
 operational disruptions, customer loss, brand damage).
 </p>

 <p>
Opportunity Costs: Potential revenue or opportunities lost due to the breach's impact on the company's reputation and customer trust.
</p>


<h4>
Hypothetical Example:</h4>

<p>
Let's assume the following hypothetical costs for a company that has experienced a data breach involving 10,000 records:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct Costs: $500,000</li>
<li>Indirect Costs: $300,000</li>
<li>Opportunity Costs: $200,000</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Calculation:
</h4>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach=($500,000+$300,000+$200,000)Ã—10,000 records
</pre>

<p>
However, the formula seems to be incorrectly applied in this context if we
 multiply the sum of costs by the number of records breached directly. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Typically, costs such as direct, indirect, and opportunity costs would be total 
 figures that already account for the scope of the breach, including the number of records. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The cost per record is often used in studies to average out these total costs across all affected records for benchmarking purposes. </p>

 <p>
So, a more accurate approach would be to calculate the total combined cost (direct, indirect, opportunity) and
 then, if needed, average this per record.</p>

 <p>
Corrected Calculation for Total Cost (without multiplying by the number of records again):
</p>

<pre>
Total Cost of Data Breach = $500,000 + $300,000 + $200,000 = $1,000,000
</pre>

<p>
If we want to find the average cost per record, we would then divide the
 total cost by the number of records breached:
</p>

<pre>
Average Cost per Record = $1,000,000/10,000 records = $100 per record
</pre>

<p>
This provides a total cost for the breach and an average cost per 
compromised record, which aligns more closely with how these calculations are typically reported and used for comparison across industries.
