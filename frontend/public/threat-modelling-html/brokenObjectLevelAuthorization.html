<p>   
Threat modelling for APIs, particularly regarding vulnerabilities like "API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)," 
involves understanding the potential risks and categorising them according to their severity.
BOLA occurs when an API endpoint that accesses a data object does not properly check that the
 user making the request has the authorization to perform the requested operation on the object. 
 This can lead to unauthorised access and manipulation of sensitive data.
</p>

<p>
Let's break this down using the STRIDE and DREAD models to understand the severity and potential impact of the BOLA vulnerability.
</p> 


<h3>STRIDE Model</h3>


<p>
STRIDE is a model used to identify security threats by categorising them into six types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure,
 Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege.
</p> 

<p>Spoofing: Not directly applicable to BOLA, since BOLA is about authorization flaws, not about impersonating users.</p>

<p>Tampering: Critical. If BOLA is present, an attacker could tamper with data they shouldn't have access to by modifying 
    requests to target objects that belong to other users.</p>

<p>Repudiation: High. The lack of proper authorization checks may make it difficult to track who accessed or modified data unlawfully, 
    making it challenging to prove malicious activity.</p>

<p>Information Disclosure: Critical. Unauthorised users could gain access to sensitive or private information they are not supposed to see.</p>

<p>Denial of Service (DoS): Medium. Although BOLA primarily concerns unauthorised access, exploiting it could indirectly lead to a 
    DoS condition if an attacker modifies or deletes critical data.</p>

<p>Elevation of Privilege: Critical. BOLA can lead to elevation of privilege if 
    an attacker accesses functionality or data reserved for higher-privileged users without proper authorization.</p>

<h3>DREAD Model</h3>

<p>DREAD is used to assess the severity of security threats based on five factors: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, 
and Discoverability.</p>


<p><strong>Damage: Critical.</strong> If an attacker exploits BOLA, the impact could include data breaches, data loss, and unauthorised data modification.</p>

<p><strong>Reproducibility: High.</strong> If the vulnerability is well-documented or the API lacks proper authorization controls uniformly, it might be easy
 for attackers to reproduce the attack. </p>

 <p><strong>Exploitability: High.</strong> Exploiting BOLA often requires minimal technical skills, as it can be as simple as changing a user 
ID in a request to access or modify another user's data.</p>


<p><strong>Affected Users: High.</strong> Depending on the application's user base, a BOLA vulnerability could affect a 
wide range of users, especially if the data involved is sensitive or critical.</p>

<p><strong>Discoverability: Medium to High.</strong> The ease of discovering a BOLA vulnerability can vary but given
 enough time or access, attackers can identify endpoints lacking proper authorization checks.</p>
