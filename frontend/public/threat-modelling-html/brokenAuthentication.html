    <p>When evaluating the threat posed by "API2:2023 - Broken Authentication" within
        the context of STRIDE and DREAD threat modelling frameworks, it's important to
        understand the nature of the vulnerability first. Broken Authentication typically
        refers to issues where attackers can compromise authentication mechanisms to impersonate
        other users, gain unauthorised access to systems, or escalate privileges. This vulnerability
        can have significant security implications for an API, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    </p>

    <h3>STRIDE Model Analysis</h3>

    <p>STRIDE is a model used to identify security threats based on six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation,
        Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege.</p>

    <p>
        Spoofing Identity (Critical): Broken Authentication directly allows for spoofing, where an attacker can assume
        the
        identity of another user. This is a critical threat as it compromises the integrity and confidentiality of the
        system.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Tampering (High):</strong> Once an attacker has bypassed authentication mechanisms, the risk of
        tampering with data
        increases. However, the direct impact is more associated with unauthorised access than the act of tampering
        itself.
        </p>


         <p>
        <strong>Repudiation (Medium):</strong>
         With successful authentication compromise, tracing actions back to the true actor becomes
        difficult. This can raise disputes over actions performed by the attacker under a spoofed identity.
        </p>


        <p>
        <strong>Information Disclosure (Critical):</strong>
         Broken Authentication can lead to unauthorised access to sensitive
        information,
        making this a critical threat to data confidentiality.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Denial of Service (Low to Medium):</strong> While not the primary concern of broken authentication,
        attackers could
        potentially lock out legitimate users or consume resources, leading to a denial of service.
        Elevation of Privilege (Critical): This vulnerability directly enables attackers to gain higher privileges than
        they
        are entitled to, posing a critical threat.

    <h3>DREAD Model Analysis</h3>

    <p>
        DREAD is another risk assessment model focusing on five categories: Damage Potential, Reproducibility,
        Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.
    </p>
    

    <p>
        <strong>Damage Potential (Critical):</strong> If an attacker exploits broken authentication, they can cause
        significant damage by
        stealing data, performing unauthorised transactions, or compromising the entire system.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong> Reproducibility (High):</strong> If the flaw is known and not patched, attackers can consistently
        reproduce the exploit.
        Exploitability (High): Depending on the specific nature of the broken authentication vulnerability, it may be
        relatively easy for an attacker with sufficient knowledge to exploit it.

    <p>
        <strong>Affected Users (Critical):</strong> All users of the API could potentially be affected by this
        vulnerability, especially if
        attackers can elevate their privileges or access sensitive information.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong> Discoverability (Medium to High):</strong> The discoverability of the vulnerability depends on how well
        the attackers
        understand the authentication mechanisms and how much information is available about the API's security
        measures.
