<p>Threat modelling involves identifying and prioritising potential threats, as well as mitigating strategies to address them. 
The STRIDE and DREAD models are two approaches used in threat modelling to classify and assess the severity of these threats.</p>

<p>Given the vulnerability "API 6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows", let's break down 
how it would be categorised under both models:</p>


<h3>STRIDE Model</h3>


<p>STRIDE is an acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. 
Each of these represents a category of threat.</p>

<p><strong>Spoofing: Not directly applicable</strong>, unless unrestricted access leads to identity spoofing.</p>

<p><strong>Tampering: High</strong> risk if attackers can modify sensitive business flows due to lack of access controls.</p>

<p><strong>Repudiation: Medium risk</strong>, as attackers might make unauthorised changes without the possibility of tracking, due to unrestricted access.</p>

<p><strong>Information Disclosure: Critical</strong>, since unrestricted access could lead to exposure of sensitive data.</p>

<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS): Medium</strong>, as unrestricted access could allow attackers to misuse business flows, potentially leading to DoS conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Elevation of Privilege: High</strong>, if unrestricted access allows an attacker to gain higher-level privileges than intended.</p>

<h3>DREAD Model</h3>

<p>DREAD is an acronym for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, 
Affected Users, and Discoverability. This model helps in assessing the severity of a threat.</p>


<p><strong>Damage: Critical</strong>, as unrestricted access to sensitive business flows can lead to significant damage, including data breaches, financial loss, 
and damage to the company's reputation.</p>

<p><strong>Reproducibility: High</strong>, assuming the vulnerability is easily exploitable by anyone who discovers it.</p>

<p><strong>Exploitability: High</strong>, if the attack vector does not require specialised knowledge, tools, or conditions to exploit.</p>

<p><strong>Affected Users: Critical</strong>, as it potentially affects all users of the API, including both internal users and external clients.</p>

<p><strong>Discoverability: High</strong>, especially if the API documentation or error messages inadvertently reveal the vulnerability to potential attackers.</p>
