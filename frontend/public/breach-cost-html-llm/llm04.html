   <p> To analyze the cost and impact of a data breach specifically for the OWASP LLM04: Model Denial of Service (DoS) scenario, we use the STRIDE and DREAD threat modeling models. This scenario involves an attacker overloading the LLM with complex queries, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.</p>
    
    <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the STRIDE and DREAD analysis:</p>

<h3>STRIDE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spoofing (Low): Not directly applicable to LLM04. An attacker wouldn't impersonate another user to trigger a DoS.</li>
<li>Tampering (Low): Not directly applicable. Tampering with data wouldn't typically lead to DoS unless it specifically targeted the LLM's processing.</li>
<li>Repudiation (Low): Not applicable to DoS attacks.</li>
<li>Information Disclosure (Low): Not applicable to DoS attacks.</li>
<li>Denial of Service (Critical): LLM04 directly exploits this category. An attacker can overload the LLM with complex queries, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
<li>Elevation of Privilege (Low): Not applicable to DoS attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DREAD</h3>
<ul>
<li>Damage (Critical): A successful DoS attack can significantly impact system availability, potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.</li>
<li>Reproducibility (High): Crafting DoS attacks against LLMs can be relatively simple, especially with automated tools.</li>
<li>Exploitability (Medium): The success of an LLM DoS attack depends on the specific LLM architecture and defenses in place. Some LLMs might be more vulnerable than others.</li>
<li>Affected Users (High): If the LLM serves a large user base, a DoS attack can impact many users simultaneously.</li>
<li>Discoverability (Medium): Information on LLM DoS vulnerabilities might be publicly available, but crafting a successful attack might require some technical knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Severity Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Critical: Denial of Service (STRIDE), Damage (DREAD)</li>
<li>High: Reproducibility (DREAD), Affected Users (DREAD)</li>
<li>Medium: Exploitability (DREAD), Discoverability (DREAD)</li>
<li>Low: Spoofing (STRIDE), Tampering (STRIDE), Repudiation (STRIDE), Information Disclosure (STRIDE), Elevation of Privilege (STRIDE)</li>
</ul>
