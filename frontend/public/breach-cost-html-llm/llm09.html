   <p> OWASP LLM09 addresses the risk of Overreliance on Large Language Models (LLMs), where excessive trust is placed in LLMs without adequate oversight. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities and problems. Let's break down this risk using the STRIDE and DREAD threat modeling approaches.</p>
    
    <h3>STRIDE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> (Medium) A malicious actor could potentially spoof an LLM or its outputs, making it appear trustworthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Tampering:</strong> (High) Malicious input or data manipulation can cause the LLM to generate incorrect or harmful outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Repudiation:</strong> (Medium) It might be difficult to determine the source of information generated by an LLM, leading to attribution challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Information Disclosure:</strong> (High) LLMs can be tricked into revealing sensitive information if not properly secured.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial-of-Service:</strong> (Medium) Overwhelming an LLM with requests could potentially lead to a denial-of-service attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Elevation of Privilege:</strong> (Low) Less applicable here, but complex LLM systems might have vulnerabilities allowing privilege escalation in specific scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DREAD</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Damage Potential:</strong> (High) Misinformation, legal issues, and security breaches due to overreliance can cause significant damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> (Medium) Exploiting overreliance requires some knowledge of the LLM and its application, making it moderately reproducible.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploitability:</strong> (Medium) The ease of exploiting overreliance depends on the specific LLM and its controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Affected Users:</strong> (High) Overreliance can impact a large number of users who trust the LLM's outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> (Medium) Overreliance might not be immediately apparent, but thorough testing and code review can help discover it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overall Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p>Based on the STRIDE and DREAD models, OWASP LLM09: Overreliance presents a Medium to High risk. It is crucial to implement mitigation strategies to address this risk and ensure that LLMs are used with appropriate oversight and validation.</p>
